		<h2 class="bold-heading">Why use a SDN - NFV solution?</h2>
		<p>Most technology, media and telecom businesses still operate at a level where computers offer very little assistance in work activities. Humans remain in control of all decisions and actions, which has an impact on the time and cost spent on complex activities.</p>

		<p class="accent-text">
			Providing automated applications can not only increase revenue and reduce costs but also vastly improve the quality of experience.
		</p>
		
		<p>SDN and NFV are complementary approaches, which both aim to advance a software-based approach to networking.</p>

		<h2 class="bold-heading">How it works</h2>
		<img src="img/sdn-nfv-how.jpg" alt="" class="u-pull-right">
		<p>SDN is a broad term that describes the separation of the management, control and data-forwarding planes of networks.</p>
		<p>While SDN is a critical step on the path to a modernised network, many services are still tied to the underlying hardware.</p>
		<p>NFV focuses on optimising the network services themselves and decouples the network function from the hardware, virtualising it. This allows it to be run in a virtual machine on any compute platform, where it can self-manage.</p>

		<p>The combination of SDN and NFV enables autonomous management, network complexity reduction and the dynamic provisioning of network services such as firewalls and load balancers. This reduces CapEx and Opex and allows service providers to create and charge for new specialised network services.</p>
